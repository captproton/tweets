cp config/config.example.yml config/config.yml
rake db:create
rake db:schema:load
script/server
fail/whale

== NOTES

This is simple ActiveRecord implementation of a semi-scalable Twitter-like following/feed system.
Postgres work is in master branch now, saved in "pg" branch. 
Waiting for Zach's work with CouchDB, but might use pg system on Heroku for smaller projects.
Zach's fork: http://github.com/zdzolton/tweets/tree/master

== TODO

when following is created, populate feed for follower with items from followed user
when following is destroyed, remove feed items for unfollower that were created by formerly followed user
database indexes
front end for tweeting, following, unfollowing
user login validations a la twitter (alphanumeric, 15 chars or less, etc)
h escaping of users/tweets on front end
proper user/login system
